# Syntegrity Dagger Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Syntegrity Dagger architecture, including system design, component interactions, and deployment patterns.

## System Overview

Syntegrity Dagger is a unified CI/CD pipeline library that provides standardized, reusable pipelines for Go projects. It's built on top of the Dagger SDK and follows a modular, extensible architecture.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Modular Design
The system is built with clear separation of concerns:
- **Application Layer**: CLI interface and application lifecycle
- **Pipeline Layer**: Pipeline implementations and orchestration
- **Step Layer**: Individual pipeline step implementations
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Dagger integration and container management

### 2. Dependency Injection
Uses a container-based dependency injection pattern for:
- Component lifecycle management
- Lazy initialization
- Testability and mocking
- Configuration management

### 3. Plugin Architecture
Extensible design allows for:
- Custom pipeline implementations
- Custom step implementations
- Hook system for pre/post processing
- Configuration extensions

### 4. Configuration Management
Multi-layered configuration system:
- Default configuration
- YAML configuration files
- Environment variable overrides
- Command-line flag overrides

## Core Components

## Extension Points

### Custom Pipelines
Developers can create custom pipeline implementations by:
1. Implementing the `Pipeline` interface
2. Registering with the pipeline registry
3. Configuring pipeline-specific options
4. Adding custom steps and hooks

### Custom Steps
New pipeline steps can be added by:
1. Implementing the `StepHandler` interface
2. Registering with the step registry
3. Defining step dependencies
4. Adding configuration options

Pre/post processing can be added by:
1. Implementing hook functions
2. Registering with the hook manager
3. Defining hook conditions
4. Managing hook lifecycle
